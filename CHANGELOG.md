## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Use font-family `sans-serif` for player time, it avoids the player from "jumping" ([Issue #212](https://github.com/podStation/podStation/issues/212))

### Fixed

- Missing Portuguese translation for "Play in reverse order"
- Fixed side effect of [Pull Request #193](https://github.com/podStation/podStation/pull/193), removing an unnecessary new line in the "All episodes from" button shown in the "Last episodes" view.

## [1.40.0] - 2021-03-30

### Added

- Player option to play next or previous episodes in reverse order (i.e. play older episodes next instead of newer)
