# v1.36.0 - Release Notes

Hello podStation user!

Here is what is new.

## New features

### Conditional Feed Updates

[Pull Request #217](https://github.com/podStation/podStation/pull/217)

During feed updates, we are now using conditional HTTP requests, which instruct the server to only send the feed data back when there are changes.  
This will reduce the data usage when updating feeds.

## Bug Fixes
